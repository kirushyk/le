**Le** is a low-level machine learning library designed for readability and ease of use. Written in pure C, it, however, employs an object-oriented approach through GObject.

Bindings are available for other languages, allowing **Le** to be used in C++ and Python programs, with Rust support planned for the future.

I originally created **Le** as a learning project while studying Andrew Ng's Deep Learning course. At the time, I didnâ€™t feel confident or fluent in Python, so I chose to implement everything in C to gain a deeper understanding and maintain control. Today, I use it to re-implement or experiment with models from research papers or open-source releases.

The name **Le** is short for "Learning". **Le** is currently under active development, with new features and updates on the way. Stay tuned!

At this moment following ML models are implemented:
* Polynomial Regression.
* Support Vector Machines (SVM).
* Sequential Feed-forward Neural Network (Multiple Layer Perceptron, MLP).
* k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm (k-NN).

Optimization algorithms supported:
* Batch Gradient Descent (BGD).
* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum.
* Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO).

Supported backends:
* NVIDIA CUDA.
* Apple Metal.
